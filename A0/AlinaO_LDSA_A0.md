# Task 1: Questions
1. A private IP address is assigned to the instance's network interface by the server and is part of a private network that is used for communication between instances in the same broadcast domain by a virtual switch or accessible by virtual router. A floating IP is not using any service or being statically set within the guest. The private IP will be used for accessing the instance by other instances in private networks while the floating IP address would be used for accessing the instance from public networks.

2. No you cannot access the Internet from the instance without assigning a floating IP to the machine because the floating IP is used for each new Instance to create a new connection.

3. A snapshot is a sub-type of images and are instantaneous copies of instances that contain an image of the state of the filesystem at the moment the snapshot is taken. An image is a bootable filesystem containing an operating system and are the basis of instances. An instance is the term for a virtual machine, it is functionally identical to a physical server but can be created or destroyed and things such as operating system, storage space, RAM and virtual CPU can be modified.

4.a) OpenStack Image Service is called Glance, b.) OpenStack Compute is called Nova

5. Booting from an image(snapshot) will create an instance containing a clean Operating system while booting from a volume(snapshot) creates an instance based on a previously used instance that has been saved in storage.

6. Changes to your instance context will not be saved after deleting the instance.

7.For an instance booted by createing a new volume, will your changes to the instance be persisted on the volume after deleteing the insance?

8. What does the snapshot do? What can you use it for?

9.What is the meaning of "Create New Volume" upon launching an instance, and in what situations would you want to "Delete Volume on Instance Delete"?

# Task 2: Questions
1. The name of the OpenStack service providing volumes is the Block storage service Cinder.

2. Cinder only allows a volume to be attached to a single host or instance.

3.Ephemeral storage is the volatile temporary storage attached to your instances which is only present during the running lifetime of the instance. In the case that the instance is stopped or terminated or underlying hardware faces an issue, any data stored on ephemeral storage would be lost. Yes, each instance by default has ephemeral storage.

4.Block storage is implemented in OpenStack by the Block Storage service (cinder). Because these volumes are persistent, they can be detached from one instance and re-attached to another instance and the data remains intact. The main difference is that ephemeral is temporary while Block Storage is persistent. Ephemeral storage has the main application of running the operating system and scratch space. Block Storage adds additional persistent storage to a virtual machine (VM).Object Storage has the main application of storing data, including VM images. Shared filed system storage adds additional persistent storage to a virtual machine.
